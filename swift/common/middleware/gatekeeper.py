The ``gatekeeper`` middleware imposes restrictions on the headers that
may be included with requests and responses. Request headers are filtered
to remove headers that should never be generated by a client. Similarly,
response headers are filtered to remove private headers that should
never be passed to a client.

The ``gatekeeper`` middleware must always be present in the proxy server
wsgi pipeline. It should be configured close to the start of the pipeline
specified in ``/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf``, immediately after catch_errors
and before any other middleware. It is essential that it is configured ahead
of all middlewares using system metadata in order that they function
correctly.

If ``gatekeeper`` middleware is not configured in the pipeline then it will be
automatically inserted close to the start of the pipeline by the proxy server.
